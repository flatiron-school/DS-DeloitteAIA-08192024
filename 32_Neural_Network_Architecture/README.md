# Neural Network Architecture

Overview of network architecture including activation functions.

## Learning Goals

- Describe the basic structure of densely connected neural networks
- Describe the various activation functions that are used in neural networks

## Lesson Materials

Two notebooks:
- [Jupyter Notebook: Neural Network Architecture](neural_network_architecture.ipynb)
- [Jupyter Notebook: Neural Network from Scratch](neural_network_from_scratch.ipynb)
